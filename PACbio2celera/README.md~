##Programs needed

List compiled by Jim Baldwin-Brown at UCI:

Hi Kevin,

Here's a list of all the necessary programs (I think).  Let me know if it
looks like I missed anything important.  I'm collecting together the
scripts that I use now, so I'll send that to you probably tomorrow.

Programs needed:

MUMmer 3.23 (latest version)
http://mummer.sourceforge.net/

Python 2.7.2 (2.7.6 is probably ok.  Not python 3.*)
https://www.python.org/download/

Celera WGS 7.0 (later versions probably ok)
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/wgs-assembler/index.php?title=Main_Page

Quake 0.3 (latest version)
http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/quake/

EA-utils.1.1.2-537 (later versions fine)
note: EA-utils is used for joining paired end reads into pontigs.  It is
not required with a normal Illumina library.

ECtools (download master branch)
